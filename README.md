This is a new Game, that i've been programming since a few weeks. My goal is to get a knowledge in SQL and to use a MySQL database with my Java code.

 I host my database local on my computer, so if you try to run the program and you have a server or a different port for your localhost, you have to change the url of the method "Connection.getNewConnection();" to your own URL:

**Disclaimer:**
*None of the data in my database are real, their random generated!*
